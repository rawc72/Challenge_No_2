                    After graduating from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science in Architectural Engineering, with a specialization in structural engineering, I worked in the construction industry for about 3-years, mostly as a resident engineer overseeing
                    construction projects. During that time, I tested the waters as an entrepreneur, building houses as a side hustle for select clients. I left the construction industry to follow a passion for diving, working as a commercial diver for
                    a small start-up, offloading crude oil from tanker vessels on the pacific coast of El Salvador for 2-years. This job was exciting, but hard on the body. In 1999, I entered the banking industry, where I have remained since, except for
                    a 2-year break when I returned to the construction industry to work for the family-owned business of a good friend.

                    My almost 20-year career in banking has been extremely satisfying. As an international banking executive, I have had the privilege of meeting many wonderful professionals and have lived in 5-countries. I have held leadership roles since the onset of my
                    banking career in areas such as risk management (where I started), corporate banking, wealth management, treasury, and more recently, general management in Panama, Dominican Republic and now in Costa Rica. In addition to my BSc in
                    Engineering, I hold an MBA from Universidad Centro Americana Jose Simeon Canas, an LLM from the University of Liverpool, I've completed the executive management program from Duke University and I am currently enrolled at the University
                    of Toronto's School of Continuing Studies Coding Boot Camp. I believe learning is a life-long journey, and one must not let time go to waste.
