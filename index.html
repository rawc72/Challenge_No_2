                    After graduating from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science in Architectural Engineering, specializing in Structural Engineering, I worked in the construction industry for about 3-years, mostly as a resident engineer overseeing
                    construction projects. During that time, I tested the waters as an entrepreneur, building houses as a side hustle for select clients. I left the construction industry to follow a passion for diving, working as a commercial diver for
                    a small start-up, offloading crude oil from tanker vessels on the pacific coast of El Salvador for 2-years. This job was exciting, but hard on the body. In 1999, I entered the banking industry, where I have remained since, except for
                    a 2-year break when I returned to the construction industry to work for the family-owned business of a good friend.

                    My almost 20-year career in banking has been extremely satisfying. As an international banking executive, I have had the privilege of building a wonderful netwok of professionals in the 5-countries I've lived in working for Scotiabank. I have held leadership
                    roles since the onset of my banking career in areas such as risk management, corporate banking, wealth management, treasury, and more recently, general management in Panama, Dominican Republic, and now in Costa Rica. In addition to
                    my BSc in Engineering, I hold an MBA from Universidad Centro Americana Jose Simeon Canas, an LLM from the University of Liverpool, I've completed the executive leadership program at Duke University and I am currently enrolled at the
                    University of Toronto's School of Continuing Studies Coding Boot Camp. For me, learning is a life-long journey - don't waste the opportunity!!
