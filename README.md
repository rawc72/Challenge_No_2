# Challenge No. 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio
The purpose of this Challenge is to create a web site for a portfolio of work where I can can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. The web site should highlight my strongest work. Because at this point in the Boot Camp I don't have a portfolio of works except for Horiseon (Challenge No. 1), I will put place holders which I will fill with links to completed work in the future.

## Acceptance Criteria
The acceptance criteria for a successfull functioning web site are:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

The following link takes you to the web site with all of the functionalities listed above: 

The <header> of the web site will look as per the image below: ![](images/WebsiteHeader.png)

## General Commentary
When producing the code, I used the mock-up provided by the Challenge to design my own portfolio web site. 
I structured the web site, and therefore the code, to resemble the mock-up with 5 different sections.
The first section is the <header>, where I included an image of myself and a <nav> bar. The <nav> bar includes links to the four sections that follow. These sections are: (i) About Me, (ii) My Work, (iii) Contact Me, and (iv) Resume.

## About Me
The About Me section includes a brief history about my college and professional life. It includes information about the universities I have attended and the different industries in which I have worked-in.

## My Work
The My Work section refers specifically to the work related to coding. Because I am new to coding, I only have the worked related to Challenge No. 1. I have included an image and two links so that any interested party can review the source code and the deployed web site. As for the other four slots to present my work, I set place holders without any links for the time being. As I expand my portfolio, I will add the more complex coding projects.

# Contact Me
The Contact Me section is divided into two components. The first component corresponds to static/traditional contact data points such as phone and emails. The second component correspnds to social media links. The social media links take the User to my social media pages where thay can have access to contact points with me.

# My Resume 
The My Resume section includes a link to a pdf file with my education, work, and other related information.
